# CICD Overview
### Continuous Integration
- Developers push the code to a code repository often (GitHub/ CodeCommit / Bitbucket / etc...)
- A testing / build server checks the code as soon as it's pushed (CodeBuild / Jenkins CI / etc...)
- The developer gets feedback about the tests and checks that have passed / failed
[Overall]
- Find bugs early, fix bugs
- Deliver faster as the code is tested
- Deploy often
- Happier developers, as they're unblocked
